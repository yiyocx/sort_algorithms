    Find largest distance
    Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes.
    The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree.
    Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes
    (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).
    The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.

    The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N).
    Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.

     One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the answer is 3.
     Note that there are other paths with maximal distance.
